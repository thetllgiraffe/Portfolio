							<h2>About Me</h2>
						</header>
						<div class="content">
							<p>My journey to code began in high school. My days outside of the classroom were spent messing around and creating my own modifications for the games I loved to play such as Skyrim, Minecraft, and the Fallout series. As I entered college I gained new skills in the development of website software. This new opportunity was the start of my professional career and down the rabbit hole I went. I discovered a passion for taking on an assortment of ideas and requests from small businesses and friends, personal projects, to corporations needing a fresh sense of creativity.</p>

							<p>During this period, COVID-19 took hold, and whilst this presented many hurdles in daily life relatable to others who've struggled, it was the perfect moment to dig in and embrace my career as a developer bringing me to today. Nowadays you can find websites with <span class="boldWords">charming, efficient, and unique</span> interfaces for users to see and enjoy.</p>

							<p>However, I don't live a sedentary life, and so you can also find me messing around with hardware and learning more on how machines work &#128187;, gaming &#127918;, or outside looking for new trails to hike &#129406;.</p>

							<p>There are many skills a developer may have and use, and so what I want to list here isn't the ones you can find on any developer's page, but the ones that stand out, the one's that are overlooked.. the ones that you might not think about but need. Anyone can make a beautiful design, but not anyone can do this:</p>

								<li class="icon solid fa-code"><span class="boldWords doubleFont">Modern Code:</span><br/>Modern frameworks, APIs, and semantics will be used to preserve the longevity of your website, and allow others down the line to easily read, edit, and add on to expand the horizon.</li>
								<li class="icon solid fa-cog"><span class="boldWords doubleFont">Support:</span><br/>All major changes, updates, and progress will be conveyed to you for peace of mind and security.</li>
